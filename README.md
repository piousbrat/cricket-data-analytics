Download the data set from the link below: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R4HIqNO3t25LU5uwfnaqb8rsDI0KN9tw/view?usp=sharing

Please do not alter the name. For example, in case of an existing file with the same name, windows chrome automatically renames the filename.csv to filename (1).csv, hence ensure that there is no existing file in the directory with the name ball_info.csv

The csv file should be saved in the R working directory.

RUn the code.

Note: In case the csv file is not in the working directory, please set the path in the second line of the code:
ball_info <- read.csv("~/ball_info.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
Provide the address to the csv file in place of "~/ball_info.csv" .
